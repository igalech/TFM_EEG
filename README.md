# TFM_EEG
This is a repo for the artifacts developed as part of my Master's thesis project in 2021 involving detection and prediction of epileptic episodes using EEG data.
Along with the code (Jupyter Notebooks) and results folder (with test results) it is recommended to access a public dataset hosted at Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/nameeman) to run the notebooks. Kaggle contains the ~2.5 Gbytes of compressed EDF files in dataset https://www.kaggle.com/nameeman/eeg-edfs-files-curated  needed in order to runthe notebooks.
